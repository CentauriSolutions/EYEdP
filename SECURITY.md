# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As EyeDP is still under active development towards a 1.0 release, the
only supported version is on the main development branch. This will
change as soon as a 1.0 release is cut.

<!--
Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.
